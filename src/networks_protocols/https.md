# ðŸ”’ HTTPS

Building on HTTP, HTTPS incorporates security protocols such as SSL/TLS to encrypt the data exchange, ensuring a secure communication channel over a potentially insecure network.

## History

HTTPS was first introduced in 1994 by Netscape Communications, and it was designed to provide secure communication over the internet.
It was initially used for payment transactions, email, and corporate information systems, but it has since become the standard for secure communication on the web.

## Structure

HTTPS is essentially the same as HTTP, but with an additional layer of security provided by SSL/TLS.

The SSL/TLS protocol uses a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption to secure the data exchange between the client and the server.
More on that later!
