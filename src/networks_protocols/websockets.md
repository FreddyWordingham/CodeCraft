# ðŸ”Œ WebSockets

An advanced protocol that facilitates interactive communication sessions between user's browsers and a server.
With WebSockets, data can flow freely and instantly in both directions, enabling real-time applications on the web.

## History

WebSockets were first introduced in 2011 as a part of the HTML5 specification.
They were designed to overcome the limitations of traditional HTTP connections, which are unidirectional and stateless.

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, allowing for real-time data exchange between the client and the server.

## Structure

WebSockets are designed to be lightweight and efficient, with minimal overhead and low latency.

The protocol is initiated with a handshake, which establishes the connection between the client and the server.
Once the connection is established, data can be sent and received in both directions without the need for repeated handshakes.

WebSockets are widely used in applications that require real-time updates, such as chat applications, online gaming, and financial trading platforms.

## Security

WebSockets can be secured using the same SSL/TLS encryption that is used to secure HTTP connections.
This ensures that the data exchanged between the client and the server is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.
