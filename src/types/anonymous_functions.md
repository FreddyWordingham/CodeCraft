# Anonymous Functions

Functions defined inline without a name, often used as arguments to other functions.
Useful for short, simple functions passed to algorithms, especially in functional programming or event handling scenarios.

```python
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y

result = multiply(2, 3)
```
