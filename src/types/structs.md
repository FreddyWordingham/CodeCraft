# Structs

Data structures composed of multiple fields.
Used to group related data together, often representing objects or entities in the real world, like a Person with name and age fields.

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

point = Point(1, 2)
```

> Note: Python doesn't have structs, but we can use classes to simulate them.
