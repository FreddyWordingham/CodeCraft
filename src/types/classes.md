# Classes

Blueprints for objects, defining their structure and behaviour.
Used in object-oriented programming to encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
```
