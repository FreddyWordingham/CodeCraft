# The Unix Philosophy

The Unix philosophy is a set of design principles that underpin the development of the Unix operating system and its descendants.

The guiding principles of the Unix philosophy are as follows:

-   Build modular programs
-   Write readable programs
-   Use composition
-   Separate mechanisms from policy
-   Write simple programs
-   Write small programs
-   Write transparent programs
-   Write robust programs
-   Make data complicated when required, not the program
-   Build on potential users' expected knowledge
-   Avoid unnecessary output
-   Write programs which fail in a way that is easy to diagnose
-   Value developer time over machine time
-   Write abstract programs that generate code instead of writing code by hand
-   Prototype software before polishing it
-   Write flexible and open programs
-   Make the program and protocols extensible

The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy strongly favors composability as opposed to monolithic design.

Although the Unix philosophy was originally documented by Ken Thompson in the context of Unix, it has since been adapted as a guiding principle in other software development projects.
