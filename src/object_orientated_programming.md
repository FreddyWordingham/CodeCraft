# Object Oriented Programming

-   **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
-   **Object**: An instance of a class.
-   **Method**: A function that is associated with an object and has access to its data.
-   **Attribute**: A variable that is associated with an object and accessible for all its methods.

-   **Encapsulation**: Keeping the internal state of an object private, and exposing only necessary parts through a public interface.
-   **Abstract class**: A class that cannot be instantiated, only inherited from.
-   **Concrete Class**: The opposite of an abstract class, this is a class that can be instantiated and often provides implementations for all its methods.

-   **Overloading**: Allowing methods or functions with the same name to perform different tasks based on parameters.
-   **Polymorphism**: The ability of different objects to respond, each in their own way, to identical messages (methods or functions).

-   **Composition**: Building complex types by combining objects of other types.
-   **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reusability.
