## By Freddy Wordingham and Will Denby

Good code is a science, because you need knowledge about the various data types, design principles, and paradigms. Good code is an art, because you need to make careful, sometimes difficult, decisions about how to use them. 

We've written CodeCraft to serve as both a primer and a reference guide. Throughout the book, we typically use Python for our examples, in an attempt to maximise accessibility. This is because Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language which:

- Emphasises code readability.
- Has a rich, “batteries included” standard library.
- Supports various programming paradigms.
- Enjoys a thriving ecosystem of open-source packages.
- Is widely used across scientific, commercial, and casual domains.
