<h2 id="-why-should-we-care-about-good-code"><a class="header" href="#-why-should-we-care-about-good-code">🏆 Why should we care about good code?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Satisfaction</strong>: Meets user needs, ensuring loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Easier updates, saves time and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Reduces downtime and errors.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Easily adapts to growing demands.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Robust features protect against breaches.</li>
<li><strong>Reputation</strong>: Enhances team credibility, opens opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h3>
<p>Here is a simple Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def factorial(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == &quot;0&quot;):
        return 1
    elif (str(n).isdigit() and int(n) &gt; 0):
        fact = 1
        i = 1
        while (i &lt;= n):
            fact = fact * i
            i += 1
        return fact
    else:
        return &quot;Error&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This function is not good code.
It is difficult to read, difficult to understand, and difficult to maintain.
It is also not very efficient, and does not handle errors well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor input validation: mixes string and integer types.</li>
<li>Inefficient and unclear looping structure.</li>
<li>Returns mixed data types (integers and strings), which is a bad practice.</li>
<li>No comments or documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall it leaves us with a distinct feeling of unease, sadness, and despair.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at a comparatively good implementation of the same function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@typechecked
def factorial(n: int):
    if n &lt; 0:
        raise ValueError(&quot;Input must be a non-negative integer&quot;)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
</code></pre>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear and strict input validation with meaningful error messages.</li>
<li>Uses recursion, which is a more elegant and Pythonic approach for this problem.</li>
<li>Consistent return type, raising exceptions for invalid inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a much better implementation.
Notice the warm feeling of satisfaction and joy that it gives us.</p>

<p>Here are a list of rules of thumb, heuristics, and principles that you might find useful in your career as a software developer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Less code is better than more code. No code is best of all.</li>
<li>Run the code as you write it.</li>
<li>If you've done the same thing four times, automate it.</li>
<li>Everything is a trade-off. There is no free lunch.</li>
<li>A user and a developer will use the same code differently.</li>
<li>Choose portability over efficiency.</li>
<li>Build a prototype as soon as possible.</li>
<li>If it works first time, be suspicious.</li>
<li>Think in type systems, even when you're not programming in a typed language.</li>
<li>Algorithms are science, software is art.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="1-less-code-is-better-than-more-code-no-code-is-best-of-all"><a class="header" href="#1-less-code-is-better-than-more-code-no-code-is-best-of-all">1. Less code is better than more code. No code is best of all.</a></h1>
<p>Every line of code you write is a line of code you have to maintain.
Every line of code you write is a line of code that can have bugs.
Every line of code you write is a line of code that can be misunderstood and misused.
Code is a liability, not an asset!</p>
<p>However, also be wary of oversimplifying to the point of obfuscation.
Sometimes, a bit more code can significantly enhance readability and maintainability.
For instance, explicit code in Python, even if slightly longer, is often preferred over cryptic one-liners for clarity.</p>
<p>Strive for simplicity and elegance; often, the most powerful solution is the most understated.</p>
<h1 id="2-run-the-code-as-you-write-it"><a class="header" href="#2-run-the-code-as-you-write-it">2. Run the code as you write it.</a></h1>
<p>Don't write a whole bunch of code and then try to run it.
Write a little bit of code, and then run it.</p>
<p>This is especially true when you're learning a new language or framework.
But it's something you should do all the time.</p>
<p>It's much easier to debug a small amount of code than a large amount of code.
And it's also much easier to solve a problem while the code while it's still fresh in your brain RAM.</p>
<p>Adopting this habit leads to a more efficient development process and helps in maintaining a clear understanding of the code's behavior at each step.
Early and frequent testing prevents the accumulation of bugs and reduces the complexity of troubleshooting.</p>
<p>But it's important to balance between testing small pieces and understanding the bigger picture.
Sometimes, focusing too much on small increments can lead to missing out on architectural flaws or bigger design issues.</p>
<h1 id="3-if-youve-done-the-same-thing-four-times-automate-it"><a class="header" href="#3-if-youve-done-the-same-thing-four-times-automate-it">3. If you've done the same thing four times, automate it.</a></h1>
<p>If you've done the same thing four times, you're probably going to do it again.
And as a rough heuristic, automating something takes about four times as long as doing it manually.
So if you've done the same thing four times, it's probably worth automating!</p>
<p>Embrace this as a catalyst for innovation and efficiency.
Automation not only saves time but also reduces errors, freeing you to focus on more complex and creative tasks.</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes the effort to automate a task can outweigh its benefits, especially if the task evolves frequently or is too complex.</p>
<h1 id="4-everything-is-a-trade-off-there-is-no-free-lunch"><a class="header" href="#4-everything-is-a-trade-off-there-is-no-free-lunch">4. Everything is a trade-off. There is no free lunch.</a></h1>
<p>A more efficient algorithm probably means more complex code.
A better user experience probably means more code to write and maintain.
A more portable program probably means a slower program.
A more secure program probably means a less usable program.</p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule here, and are often matters of opinion that lead to heated debates.
But it's important to remember that everything is a trade-off.
There is no such thing as a perfect solution.</p>
<p>In every decision, seek balance and prioritize based on the context and goals.
Recognizing and managing these trade-offs is a hallmark of great engineering.</p>
<p>It's equally important to contextualize these trade-offs within the specific requirements of a project.
For instance, in high-performance computing, efficiency might take precedence over portability.</p>
<h1 id="5-a-user-and-a-developer-will-use-the-same-code-differently"><a class="header" href="#5-a-user-and-a-developer-will-use-the-same-code-differently">5. A user and a developer will use the same code differently.</a></h1>
<p>A user will use your code in ways you never imagined, intended or wanted.</p>
<p>It's very difficult for us as developers to image how a user with no knowledge of the internals of our code will use it.
Because we know how it works, we use it in exactly the way it was intended.</p>
<p>This underscores the importance of designing with empathy and robustness.
Always expect the unexpected and design for it.
Our code should be as intuitive as it is functional.</p>
<p>But again, balance!
Overemphasizing user flexibility can sometimes lead to overly complex code structures.</p>
<h1 id="6-choose-portability-over-efficiency"><a class="header" href="#6-choose-portability-over-efficiency">6. Choose portability over efficiency.</a></h1>
<p>A more portable program might well mean making concessions in terms of efficiency and what technologies you can use.
However, a brilliant program is no good if the user can't run it.</p>
<p>Web technologies are a great way to build portable programs.
And with the advent of WebAssembly, you can even run programs written in other languages in the browser.
WebGPU is also on the horizon, which will allow you to write high-performance graphics code in the browser!</p>
<p>Remember, the reach and accessibility of our software often trump raw performance.
Strive to build software that is inclusive and available to a wider audience, leveraging emerging technologies to bridge gaps in efficiency.</p>
<p>It's quite rare that in the commercial world, you need to squeeze every last drop of performance out of your code.
But it may happen.
If it does, you can always rewrite the performance-critical parts in a lower-level language like C or Rust.</p>
<h1 id="7-build-a-prototype-as-soon-as-possible"><a class="header" href="#7-build-a-prototype-as-soon-as-possible">7. Build a prototype as soon as possible.</a></h1>
<p>It's unlikely we know what all the hurdles are going to be until we get our hands dirty.
And a prototype is a great way to test our ideas and get feedback from users.</p>
<p>Building an minimal viable product (MVP) is how we can quickly validate our ideas and get a sense of what works and what doesn't.</p>
<p>Embrace the iterative process; each prototype iteration brings clarity and refinement. This approach not only saves time and resources but also keeps the project aligned with user needs and market demands.</p>
<p>Rapid prototyping is essential, but it's important not to rush into building without sufficient planning.
Sometimes, spending extra time in the design phase can save considerable time later by avoiding major reworks.</p>
<h1 id="8-if-it-works-first-time-be-suspicious"><a class="header" href="#8-if-it-works-first-time-be-suspicious">8. If it works first time, be suspicious.</a></h1>
<p>I always get nervous when my code works first time.
Perhaps it comes from when we first learn to program, and things are more often broken than not.
But I think it's a good rule of thumb to be suspicious of code that works first time.</p>
<p>As we become more experienced we get better at writing code, but we may also become more complacent.</p>
<p>Always double-check and rigorously test your code, even when it seems to work perfectly.
This practice is not about doubting your skills but ensuring quality and reliability.
The best developers know that the devil is often in the details, and thorough validation is key.</p>
<h1 id="9-think-in-type-systems-even-when-youre-not-programming-in-a-typed-language"><a class="header" href="#9-think-in-type-systems-even-when-youre-not-programming-in-a-typed-language">9. Think in type systems, even when you're not programming in a typed language.</a></h1>
<p>Even if you're not programming in a typed language, it's still useful to think in terms of types.
Whilst we won't know the specific values going through the pipe, we should still have a good idea of what <em>type</em> of data we're dealing with.</p>
<p>If we're building an API, or a library, or a framework, we should be thinking about the types of data that are going to be passed in and out of our code.
This way other developers can write code that will interface with ours - even if it's not built yet!</p>
<p>Considering types enhances clarity, maintainability, and interoperability of your code.
It's about anticipating how your code interacts with other parts of the system and ensuring that these interactions are as smooth and error-free as possible.</p>
<p>However, it's also important to leverage the strengths of dynamically typed languages where appropriate, as they can offer flexibility and speed in development.</p>
<h1 id="10-algorithms-are-science-software-is-art"><a class="header" href="#10-algorithms-are-science-software-is-art">10. Algorithms are science, software is art.</a></h1>
<p>Baking is a science, cooking is an art.</p>
<p>Baking is a science because you have to follow the recipe exactly.
You mix the ingredients, and then you put them in the oven for a certain amount of time at a specific temperature, and then hopefully a beautiful cake comes out.</p>
<p>Cooking is an art because you can improvise.
Nay, you must improvise!
You taste as you go, and you adapt as the dish develops.
If the sauce is too bland, you add more salt.
If the sauce is too thin, you add more flour.
If things start to burn, you turn down the heat.
The evolving nature of the dish means that you often don't follow the recipe to the letter.
You interpret it, and you adapt it to your own tastes.</p>
<p>Developing algorithms is a science, developing software is an art.</p>
<p>An algorithms objectives are usually well defined and unambiguous.
Often maximize speed and/or minimize memory usage.</p>
<p>However, a complete program often too complex to be approached in the same way.
There are many more moving parts to consider, and the objectives are often more subjective.</p>
<p>Your role as a developer is not only to construct efficient algorithms but to sculpt a software architecture that anticipates and accommodates future changes, growth, and challenges.</p>
<h1 id="recap"><a class="header" href="#recap">Recap</a></h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Less code, more impact</strong>: Every line of code is a potential bug. Striving for simplicity is key. In Python, the Zen of Python (import this) emphasizes readability and simplicity, a testament to this principle.</li>
<li><strong>Iterative development</strong>: Running code as you write is crucial. Tools like Jupyter notebooks for Python and REPL environments in languages like JavaScript foster this practice. It aligns well with the agile development approach.</li>
<li><strong>Automation is your ally</strong>: The automation principle is a cornerstone of modern DevOps practices. Using tools like Ansible for automation, or writing custom scripts in Python, can save immense amounts of time.</li>
<li><strong>Trade-offs are everywhere</strong>: This is a core concept in software architecture. The balance between scalability, performance, and maintainability is always a juggling act.</li>
<li><strong>Design for the user</strong>: Understanding the user's perspective is crucial. This is where user stories and personas in agile methodologies become valuable.</li>
<li><strong>Portability vs. Efficiency</strong>: Web technologies like React (JavaScript) and WebAssembly for more performance-intensive tasks are reshaping how we think about portable software.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype early</strong>: MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and rapid prototyping are vital in today's fast-paced tech environment. Tools like Flask for Python provide a quick way to get a web server running for prototyping.</li>
<li><strong>Healthy skepticism</strong>: A &quot;too good to be true&quot; scenario often is. Rigorous testing and validation, maybe using Python's unittest or JavaScript's Jest, are essential.</li>
<li><strong>Type systems</strong>: Even in dynamically typed languages like Python, type hinting (PEP 484) has gained traction. It improves readability and maintainability.</li>
<li><strong>Art and science of coding</strong>: This beautifully captures the essence of software development. It's not just about solving problems but about how elegantly and sustainably you solve them.</li>

<li>Learning Curve: Can be difficult to learn, especially for beginners.</li>
<li>Immaturity: Still a young language, with a smaller community and ecosystem compared to more established languages.</li>

<p>All programming languages are Turing complete, meaning they can be used to solve any problem that can be solved by a computer.
However, some languages are better suited to certain tasks than others.
This is because each language is designed with a specific paradigm in mind.</p>
<p>A programming paradigm is a style or way of thinking about programming.
It's not a specific language feature or syntax, but rather a way of approaching software design.
A paradigm is a set of rules and regulations that define how a programmer can build a program to solve a problem.</p>

<h2 id="imperative-programming"><a class="header" href="#imperative-programming">Imperative Programming</a></h2>
<p>Dates back to the earliest programming languages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">initialize result = 0
for each item in list:
    add item to result
return result
</code></pre>
<p>Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state.
It involves writing a sequence of instructions for the computer to follow and often reflects the way humans think about how a task is accomplished. The instructions tell the computer how to perform a series of steps that lead to a desired goal.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Assembly languages and early high-level languages like Fortran and COBOL were imperative, focusing on how a program operates.</p>
<h2 id="procedural-programming"><a class="header" href="#procedural-programming">Procedural Programming</a></h2>
<p>Emerged in the 1950s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">function addNumbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = addNumbers(5, 3)
</code></pre>
<p>Procedural programming, a subtype of imperative programming, is based on the concept of procedure calls.
It structures programs as a collection of procedures, also known as routines or functions, which are blocks of code that perform a specific task.
In procedural programming, a program is typically divided into reusable and modular procedures, each handling a part of the task. This approach promotes code reusability and clarity.
C is a classic example of a procedural programming language.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Fortran (1957). It was one of the first high-level languages to implement procedural programming, focusing on the procedure of the program.</p>
<h2 id="functional-programming"><a class="header" href="#functional-programming">Functional Programming</a></h2>
<p>Originated in the 1950s, but gained popularity in the 1970s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">function applyFunctionToList(func, list):
    return list.map(func)

applyFunctionToList(x =&gt; x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
</code></pre>
<p>Functional programming is a paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, which avoid shared state and mutable data.
In functional programming, the output value of a function depends only on its arguments, making it easier to predict and test.
This paradigm is known for its expressiveness and is used in languages like Haskell and Scala.
It's particularly suited for parallel processing and complex computations, fitting well with your interest in programming and physics.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Lisp (1958). It's one of the earliest languages supporting functional programming, emphasizing functions and recursion.</p>
<h2 id="object-oriented-programming-oop"><a class="header" href="#object-oriented-programming-oop">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</a></h2>
<p>Emerged in the 1960s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">class Animal:
    function makeSound():
        print &quot;Some sound&quot;

class Dog inherits Animal:
    function makeSound():
        print &quot;Bark&quot;

dog = new Dog()
dog.makeSound()
</code></pre>

In functional programming, the output value of a function depends only on its arguments, making it easier to predict and test.
This paradigm is known for its expressiveness and is used in languages like Haskell and Scala.
It's particularly suited for parallel processing and complex computations, fitting well with your interest in programming and physics.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Simula (1967). Often credited as the first language to offer object-oriented features like classes and objects.</p>
<h2 id="structured-programming"><a class="header" href="#structured-programming">Structured Programming</a></h2>
<p>Gained prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">if condition:
    doActionA()
else:
    doActionB()
while anotherCondition:
    repeatAction()
</code></pre>
<p>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of subroutines, block structures, for and while loops, and if/then/else structures.
It's a subset of imperative programming, focusing on linear flow and clear, structured control constructs. This approach avoids using the GOTO statement, which can lead to complex or unmanageable code.
Structured programming makes programs easier to understand and modify, and is fundamental in languages like C and Pascal.
As a programmer, you'd appreciate its emphasis on straightforward, maintainable code structures.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: ALGOL (1958). Influenced subsequent languages like C for structured programming, focusing on clear structure and blocks.</p>
<h2 id="logic-programming"><a class="header" href="#logic-programming">Logic Programming</a></h2>
<p>Emerged in the 1970s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">isDog(Animal): -Animal hasFur, Animal barks. query isDog(spot) .;
</code></pre>
<p>Logic programming is a programming paradigm based on formal logic.
In logic programming, you write programs by declaring statements in logical form, and the program execution involves finding solutions that satisfy these statements.
The most notable feature is that it focuses on what needs to be done, rather than how to do it, making it a form of declarative programming.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Prolog (1972). Introduced the paradigm of logic programming, focusing on formal logic.</p>
<h2 id="declarative-programming"><a class="header" href="#declarative-programming">Declarative Programming</a></h2>
<p>Became more distinct as a paradigm in the 1970s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT name FROM users WHERE age &gt; 20
</code></pre>
<p>Declarative programming is a style of building programs that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
In contrast to imperative programming, which focuses on the &quot;how&quot; to achieve something, declarative programming focuses on the &quot;what&quot; - the outcome you want to achieve.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: SQL (1974) for databases and Prolog for logic programming. These languages allow the programmer to express the logic without necessarily detailing the control flow.</p>
<h2 id="concurrent-programming"><a class="header" href="#concurrent-programming">Concurrent Programming</a></h2>
<p>Became more prominent in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-vbnet">thread1:
    while true:
        performTaskA()

thread2:
    while true:
        performTaskB()

start thread1
start thread2
</code></pre>
<p>Concurrent programming is a computing paradigm in which several computations are executed during overlapping time periods—concurrently—instead of sequentially.
This is a form of computing in which multiple processes are executing and making progress at the same time.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Ada (1980). It was designed with built-in support for concurrent programming, including features for handling tasks, synchronization, and communication.</p>
<h2 id="event-driven-programming"><a class="header" href="#event-driven-programming">Event-Driven Programming</a></h2>
<p>Rose to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function onClick(event):
    print &quot;Button clicked&quot;

button.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, onClick)
</code></pre>
<p>Event-driven programming is a paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.
It's a prominent model in developing applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), real-time systems, and other systems that need to respond to changes in their environment or user interactions.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Visual Basic (1991) and other GUI-based languages. This paradigm is centered around the system responding to user or system-generated events.</p>
<h2 id="reflective-programming"><a class="header" href="#reflective-programming">Reflective Programming</a></h2>
<p>Gained attention in the 1980s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">object = getObject()
if object hasMethod &quot;update&quot;:
    object.update()
</code></pre>
<p>Reflective programming is a programming paradigm that allows a program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.
This kind of programming is closely related to the ability of a program to introspect or reflect upon itself, hence the term &quot;reflective.&quot;</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Smalltalk (1980). One of the first languages to support reflection, allowing a program to manipulate the structure and behavior of the program itself.</p>
<h2 id="aspect-oriented-programming-aop"><a class="header" href="#aspect-oriented-programming-aop">Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)</a></h2>
<p>Emerged in the late 1990s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">aspect Logging {
    before methodCall():
        log &quot;Method called&quot;
}

call methodCall() // Logging happens automatically
</code></pre>
<p>Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.
It does this by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a &quot;pointcut&quot; specification, such as &quot;log all function calls when the function's name begins with 'set'&quot;.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: AspectJ (2001). An extension of Java, AspectJ was one of the first languages to support AOP, which allows separation of cross-cutting concerns.</p>
<h2 id="generic-programming"><a class="header" href="#generic-programming">Generic Programming</a></h2>
<p>Gained prominence in the 1990s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function sortList&lt;T&gt;(list: List&lt;T&gt;): List&lt;T&gt;
    // sort logic here
    return sortedList

sortedNumbers = sortList&lt;Number&gt;([3, 1, 4])
sortedStrings = sortList&lt;String&gt;([&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;])
</code></pre>
<p>Generic programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures in a way that they can work with any data type.
The key idea is to write code that is independent of any specific type and can be reused with different types. This is achieved through the use of generics, which allow you to write a function or class to work with any data type, specified as a parameter.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Ada and C++ (with templates introduced in 1989). This paradigm focuses on writing algorithms in terms of types to be specified later.</p>
<h2 id="metaprogramming"><a class="header" href="#metaprogramming">Metaprogramming</a></h2>
<p>While the concept is older, it gained particular traction in the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">program generateProgram(input):
    code = &quot;function doSomething() { return &quot; + input + &quot; }&quot;
    return compile(code)

newProgram = generateProgram(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
newProgram.doSomething() // returns &quot;Hello World&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data.
It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.</p>
<p>Early Supporter: Lisp (with macros) and later Ruby and Python. This involves writing programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-unix-philosophy"><a class="header" href="#the-unix-philosophy">The Unix Philosophy</a></h1>
<p>The Unix philosophy is a set of design principles that underlie the development of the Unix operating system and its descendants.</p>
<p>The guiding principles of the Unix philosophy are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build modular programs</li>
<li>Write readable programs</li>
<li>Use composition</li>
<li>Separate mechanisms from policy</li>
<li>Write simple programs</li>
<li>Write small programs</li>
<li>Write transparent programs</li>
<li>Write robust programs</li>
<li>Make data complicated when required, not the program</li>
<li>Build on potential users' expected knowledge</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary output</li>
<li>Write programs which fail in a way that is easy to diagnose</li>
<li>Value developer time over machine time</li>
<li>Write abstract programs that generate code instead of writing code by hand</li>
<li>Prototype software before polishing it</li>
<li>Write flexible and open programs</li>
<li>Make the program and protocols extensible.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators.
The Unix philosophy strongly favors composability as opposed to monolithic design.</p>
<p>Although the Unix philosophy was originally documented by Ken Thompson in the context of Unix, it has since been adapted as a guiding principle in other software development projects.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="undecidability"><a class="header" href="#undecidability">Undecidability</a></h1>
<p>As a matter of fact, there are some problems that are not solvable.
An elegant proof of this was devised by Alan Turing in 1936.</p>
<p>The Halting Problem demonstrates that <strong>no machine</strong> can decide whether an arbitrary computer program will finish running (halt) or continue to run indefinitely, for all possible inputs.</p>
<p>Turing's proof uses a technique called diagonalization, showing that if such an algorithm existed, it could be used to construct a program that contradicts its own output, leading to a paradox.
This result has profound implications in theoretical computer science, establishing limits on what can be computed.</p>
<h2 id="the-halting-problem"><a class="header" href="#the-halting-problem">The Halting Problem</a></h2>
<p>Let's start by assuming we have some machine <code>H</code> that can solve the halting problem.
This machine takes two inputs: a program <code>p</code> and an input <code>i</code>, and returns <code>true</code> if <code>p</code> halts on <code>i</code>, and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LR
    A[Program] --&gt;|p| H[&quot;       H       &quot;]
    B[Input] --&gt;|i| H
    H --&gt;|yes| C[Program halts]
    H --&gt;|no| D[Runs indefinitely]
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's extend this machine to a new machine <code>H+</code> which again takes two inputs: a program <code>p</code> and an input <code>i</code>, but this time <code>H+</code> uses <code>H</code> to decide whether <code>p</code> halts on <code>p</code> itself.</p>
<p>If it does, then <code>H+</code> runs an infinite loop, otherwise it halts.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="-solid-principles"><a class="header" href="#-solid-principles">🛠️ SOLID Principles</a></h1>
<p>The SOLID principles are a set of principles that help us write better, more maintainable code.</p>
<p>They were coined by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) in the year 2000 in his paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906155800/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf">Design Principles and Design Patterns</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="./solid/SRP.html">👤 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</a></p>
<p>Each class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
This principle advocates for having classes that are highly cohesive and focused on a single task or responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./solid/OCP.html">🔒 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</a></p>
<p>Software entities (like classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
This principle encourages us to write code that doesn’t have to be changed every time the requirements change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./solid/LSP.html">🔄 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</a></p>
<p>Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.
This principle is key for achieving polymorphic behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./solid/ISP.html">🔌 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</a></p>
<p>No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
This principle suggests that it’s better to have many specific interfaces than one general-purpose interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./solid/DIP.html">🔝 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</a></p>
<p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details.
Details should depend on abstractions.
This principle aims at reducing dependencies amongst the code modules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="-single-responsibility-principle"><a class="header" href="#-single-responsibility-principle">👤 Single Responsibility Principle</a></h1>
<p>This is the simplest of the five principles, and it is also the most important.</p>
<p>Simply put, the single responsibility principle (SRP) states that a unit of code should do exactly one thing.</p>
<p>This principle is often misunderstood, and it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that a class should only have one method, or that a method should only have one line of code.
The single responsibility principle is not about the number of methods or lines of code, but rather about the number of responsibilities.</p>
<p>A responsibility is a reason to change.</p>
<p>If we have a class that has two methods, and we can imagine a situation where we would want to change one method without changing the other, then the class has more than one responsibility.
It should be split into two classes, each with a single responsibility.</p>
<p>If we have a method that is 100 lines long, but we can imagine a situation where we would want to change one half of the method without changing the other half, then the method has more than one responsibility.
It should be split into two methods, each with a single responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="bad-example-not-following-srp"><a class="header" href="#bad-example-not-following-srp">Bad example: Not following SRP</a></h2>
<p>Let's consider a class EmployeeManager that handles employee data, but also generates reports, (which is not its primary responsibility).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class EmployeeManager:
    def add_employee(self, employee):
        # Add an employee to the database
        pass

    def remove_employee(self, employee_id):
        # Remove an employee from the database
        pass

    def generate_employee_report(self):
        # Logic to generate a report about employees
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>This class has two responsibilities: managing employees and generating reports.
This is a violation of the single responsibility principle, and it should be split into two classes.</p>
<h2 id="good-example-following-srp"><a class="header" href="#good-example-following-srp">Good example: Following SRP</a></h2>
<pre><code class="language-python">class EmployeeManager:
    def add_employee(self, employee):
        # Add an employee to the database
        pass

    def remove_employee(self, employee_id):
        # Remove an employee from the database
        pass

class EmployeeReportGenerator:
    def generate_employee_report(self):
        # Logic to generate a report about employees
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have two classes, each with a single responsibility.
This makes the code easier to understand, and it makes it easier to change the code in the future.</p>
<h2 id="recap-1"><a class="header" href="#recap-1">Recap</a></h2>
<p>It's key to remember that SRP is about reducing the impact of change.
A class with a single responsibility has only one reason to change, making the code more robust and adaptable.
This principle is especially crucial in a fast-paced development environment where requirements change frequently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad Example</strong>: The EmployeeManager class handling both employee management and report generation.
This is a classic SRP violation because there are two distinct reasons for change - one related to employee data manipulation and the other to report generation logic.</li>
<li><strong>Good Example</strong>: Separating these concerns into EmployeeManager and EmployeeReportGenerator.
This adheres to SRP, as each class now has a distinct, singular responsibility.
Changes in the report format or generation logic won't affect the employee management functionality and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>This separation not only makes the code more maintainable but also enhances testing.
It's easier to write and maintain tests for classes with a single responsibility, which ultimately leads to more reliable software.</p>
<p>Remember, applying SRP can sometimes feel counterintuitive, especially when it leads to more classes or components.
However, in the long run, it significantly simplifies maintenance and scalability.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="-openclosed-principle"><a class="header" href="#-openclosed-principle">🔒 Open/Closed Principle</a></h1>
<p>The open/closed principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</p>
<p>Simply put, this means that we should write code that doesn't have to be changed every time the requirements change.</p>
<p>This principle is often misunderstood, and it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that we should never change code once it has been written.
The open/closed principle is not about never changing code, but rather about writing code that is easy to change.</p>
<h2 id="bad-example-not-following-openclosed-principle"><a class="header" href="#bad-example-not-following-openclosed-principle">Bad Example: Not Following Open/Closed Principle</a></h2>
<p>Imagine a simple Shape class that calculates the area of different shapes.
Initially, it only handles rectangles.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Shape:
    def __init__(self, shape_type, dimensions):
        self.shape_type = shape_type
        self.dimensions = dimensions

    def area(self):
        if self.shape_type == &quot;rectangle&quot;:
            return self.dimensions['length'] * self.dimensions['width']
        # Adding a new shape means modifying this method

# Usage
rectangle = Shape(&quot;rectangle&quot;, {&quot;length&quot;: 5, &quot;width&quot;: 10})
print(&quot;Area:&quot;, rectangle.area())
</code></pre>
<p>Problem: To add a new shape (e.g., circle), we must modify the Shape class, violating the open/closed principle.</p>
<h2 id="good-example-following-openclosed-principle"><a class="header" href="#good-example-following-openclosed-principle">Good Example: Following Open/Closed Principle</a></h2>
<p>Let's refactor using polymorphism.
Create an abstract Shape class and extend it for each specific shape.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

# Usage
shapes = [Rectangle(5, 10), Circle(7)]
for shape in shapes:
    print(&quot;Area:&quot;, shape.area())
</code></pre>
<p>This design is open for extension (easy to add new shapes) but closed for modification (no need to change existing code).</p>
<h2 id="recap-2"><a class="header" href="#recap-2">Recap</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>bad example</strong>, the need to modify the Shape class for each new shape type shows how the design is not sustainable.
This approach leads to a class that's difficult to maintain and prone to errors, especially as the system grows and evolves.</li>
<li>The <strong>good example</strong> illustrates the right approach by using polymorphism.
By defining an abstract Shape class and extending it for specific shapes, we adhere to OCP.
This design allows new shape types to be added (like Circle, Triangle, etc.) without altering the existing code.
Each shape class encapsulates its own logic for calculating the area, adhering to both OCP and SRP.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: It's easier to understand and maintain separate classes, each responsible for the behavior of a specific shape.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Adding a new shape is as simple as creating a new class that extends Shape.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Risk of Bugs</strong>: Changes to one shape type don't affect others, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: Each shape can be tested independently, leading to more robust and reliable code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The essence of OCP is to write code that accommodates future growth and change with minimal modification to existing code.
It's a key principle in building scalable and flexible systems.</p>

<p>Let's continue with the Shape example from the previous section.
Imagine that we want to add a Square class that extends the Rectangle class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, side):
        super().__init__(side, side)

    def set_width(self, width):
        self.width = self.length = width

    def set_length(self, length):
        self.length = self.width = length

# Usage
def process_shape(r: Rectangle):
    r.set_width(10)
    return r.area()

square = Square(5)
print(&quot;Expected area of 5x10 square:&quot;, process_shape(square))  # Incorrectly returns 100
</code></pre>
<p>This is bad because changing the width of a Square changes its length too, which is unexpected for a Rectangle.
It breaks the LSP as Square cannot be substituted for Rectangle without altering the program's behavior.</p>
<h2 id="good-example-following-lsp"><a class="header" href="#good-example-following-lsp">Good Example: Following LSP</a></h2>
<p>Instead of inheritance, use a common interface or separate classes for shapes that don't share properties.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    # Same as before

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side

    def area(self):
        return self.side * self.side

# Usage remains the same
</code></pre>
<p>In this design, Square and Rectangle are separate entities
There's no unexpected behavior when a Square is used in place of a Rectangle because they are not interchangeable, adhering to LSP.</p>
<h2 id="recap-3"><a class="header" href="#recap-3">Recap</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>bad example</strong>, Square extending Rectangle leads to a violation of LSP.
It's tempting to use inheritance here because a square is a special kind of rectangle, but this relationship doesn't hold up in code when their behaviors (like setting width or length) differ.
When a Square object replaces a Rectangle object, it breaks the expectations of how a Rectangle should behave, specifically in the process_shape function.</li>
<li>The <strong>good example</strong> correctly addresses this by treating Square and Rectangle as separate entities that both implement a common Shape interface.
This approach respects LSP, as each class can be substituted for a Shape without changing the correctness of the program.
Here, there's no assumption or requirement that a Square must behave like a Rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few key takeaways about LSP:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Behavioral Subtyping</strong>: LSP is essentially about behavioral subtyping.
Subtypes should be able to replace their base types without altering the desired behavior of the program.</li>
<li><strong>Design Thoughtfulness</strong>: It encourages careful thought when using inheritance.
Not all &quot;is-a&quot; relationships in the real world translate well to code.</li>
<li><strong>Robustness</strong>: Adhering to LSP leads to more robust and flexible code, where components can be easily interchanged without causing issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing LSP properly often leads to better abstraction in our code, allowing for more flexible and reusable components.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="-interface-segregation-principle"><a class="header" href="#-interface-segregation-principle">🔌 Interface Segregation Principle</a></h1>
<p>The interface segregation principle (ISP) states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.</p>
<p>This principle is often misunderstood, and it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that it is about interfaces.
The interface segregation principle is not about interfaces, but rather about the clients of a class or module.</p>
<h2 id="bad-example-not-following-isp"><a class="header" href="#bad-example-not-following-isp">Bad Example: Not Following ISP</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we modify the Shape interface to include a method for calculating the perimeter.
Not all shapes might need this method, but they are forced to implement it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    # Area implementation
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)

class Circle(Shape):
    # Area implementation
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius

class Triangle(Shape):
    # Area implementation
    # Triangle might not need a perimeter method, but it's forced to implement it
    def perimeter(self):
        pass  # Not applicable or not needed for some triangles
</code></pre>
<p>This is bad because the Triangle class is forced to implement a method that it doesn't need.</p>
<h2 id="good-example-following-isp"><a class="header" href="#good-example-following-isp">Good Example: Following ISP</a></h2>
<p>Refactor by creating separate interfaces for area and perimeter calculations, so that each shape only implements the necessary interfaces.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Area(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Perimeter(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Area, Perimeter):
    # Implement both area and perimeter

class Circle(Area, Perimeter):
    # Implement both area and perimeter

class Triangle(Area):
    # Implement only area, no need for perimeter
</code></pre>
<p>This design adheres to ISP, as each shape class only implements the interfaces it needs.
Triangle is not forced to depend on the perimeter method, which it might not use.</p>
<h2 id="recap-4"><a class="header" href="#recap-4">Recap</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>bad example</strong> demonstrates how enforcing a common interface with methods that are not universally applicable can lead to awkward and potentially problematic implementations.
The Triangle class having to implement a perimeter method that it doesn't need is a clear violation of ISP.
This leads to bloated interfaces and can cause confusion and errors, especially if dummy implementations are used.</li>
<li>The <strong>good example</strong> is a great demonstration of adhering to ISP.
By separating the concerns into two interfaces, Area and Perimeter, each class implements only what is necessary for its purpose.
This approach makes the system more flexible and easier to understand.
It also enhances maintainability, as changes in the calculation of the area or perimeter only affect relevant classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key points about ISP:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client-Centric Design</strong>: ISP emphasizes designing from the client's perspective.
Classes shouldn't be burdened with irrelevant methods just because they share some common features with other classes.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Impact of Changes</strong>: By segregating interfaces, changes in one part of the system are less likely to affect unrelated parts.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Understanding and Maintenance</strong>: Smaller, well-defined interfaces are easier to understand and implement correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing ISP correctly is crucial for creating clean, maintainable code.
It ensures that classes only have the dependencies they need, which is especially important in large systems where unnecessary dependencies can significantly complicate the codebase.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="-dependency-inversion-principle"><a class="header" href="#-dependency-inversion-principle">🔝 Dependency Inversion Principle</a></h1>
<p>The dependency inversion principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details.
Details should depend on abstractions.</p>
<p>This principle is often misunderstood, and it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that it is about dependency injection.
The dependency inversion principle is not about dependency injection, but rather about the direction of dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="bad-example-not-following-dip"><a class="header" href="#bad-example-not-following-dip">Bad Example: Not Following DIP</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we have a high-level module that depends on a low-level module.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class EmployeeManager:
    def __init__(self, employee_database):
        self.employee_database = employee_database

    def add_employee(self, employee):
        self.employee_database.add(employee)

    def remove_employee(self, employee_id):
        self.employee_database.remove(employee_id)
</code></pre>
<p>This is bad because the high-level module (EmployeeManager) depends on the low-level module (employee_database).
If the low-level module changes, the high-level module must change too.</p>
<h2 id="good-example-following-dip"><a class="header" href="#good-example-following-dip">Good Example: Following DIP</a></h2>
<p>Refactor by introducing an abstraction (interface) between the high-level and low-level modules.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class EmployeeDatabase(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def add(self, employee):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def remove(self, employee_id):
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>This design adheres to DIP, as the high-level module (EmployeeManager) depends on an abstraction (EmployeeDatabase) instead of a low-level module.
If the low-level module changes, the high-level module doesn't need to change.</p>
<h2 id="recap-5"><a class="header" href="#recap-5">Recap</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>bad example</strong>, the direct dependency of EmployeeManager on a concrete employee_database implementation exemplifies a violation of DIP.
This tight coupling makes the high-level module (EmployeeManager) susceptible to changes in the low-level module (employee_database), which is undesirable.
Such a design makes the system rigid and hard to maintain, especially when changes or new requirements emerge.</li>
<li>The <strong>good example</strong> demonstrates the proper implementation of DIP.
By introducing an abstract EmployeeDatabase interface, EmployeeManager becomes dependent on an abstraction rather than a concrete implementation.
This decouples the high-level module from the details of the low-level module, allowing for greater flexibility.
If the implementation of the database changes, EmployeeManager remains unaffected, as it relies solely on the interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key aspects of DIP:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decoupling</strong>: It promotes loose coupling between classes, which enhances modularity and makes the system more resilient to changes.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: It allows for easier substitution of modules.
For example, switching from one database implementation to another becomes trivial.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Changes in low-level modules don’t necessitate changes in high-level modules, reducing the maintenance burden.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that while DIP and Dependency Injection (DI) are related, they are not the same.
DI is a technique for achieving DIP, typically involving frameworks that automatically handle the creation and binding of dependencies.
DIP, on the other hand, is a broader design principle aimed at reducing dependencies between high-level and low-level modules.</p>
<p>Our application of DIP enhances the design and maintainability of our code, aligning with best practices in software architecture.</p>

<h3 id="1-use-nouns-instead-of-verbs"><a class="header" href="#1-use-nouns-instead-of-verbs">1. Use nouns instead of verbs</a></h3>
<p>Use nouns to represent resources, and avoid using verbs.
For example, use <code>/users</code> instead of <code>/getUsers</code>.</p>
<h3 id="2-use-plural-nouns"><a class="header" href="#2-use-plural-nouns">2. Use plural nouns</a></h3>
<p>Use plural nouns for consistency and to make the API easier to understand.
For example, use <code>/users</code> instead of <code>/user</code>.</p>
<h3 id="3-use-sub-resources-for-relations"><a class="header" href="#3-use-sub-resources-for-relations">3. Use sub-resources for relations</a></h3>
<p>Use sub-resources to express relations between resources.
For example, use <code>/users/{userId}/posts</code> instead of <code>/posts?userId={userId}</code>.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-http-methods"><a class="header" href="#4-use-http-methods">4. Use HTTP methods</a></h3>
<p>Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to operate on the collections and elements.
For example, use GET <code>/users</code> to get a list of users.
And use GET <code>/users/{userId}</code> to get a specific user.</p>
<p>They should follow CRUD (<strong>C</strong>reate, <strong>R</strong>ead <strong>U</strong>pdate <strong>D</strong>elete) operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GET</code> to retrieve a resource.</li>
<li><code>POST</code> to create a resource.</li>

<li><code>DELETE</code> to remove a resource.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-provide-filtering-sorting-and-pagination"><a class="header" href="#5-provide-filtering-sorting-and-pagination">5. Provide filtering, sorting, and pagination</a></h3>
<p>Use query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination.</p>
<h3 id="6-handle-errors-gracefully"><a class="header" href="#6-handle-errors-gracefully">6. Handle errors gracefully</a></h3>
<p>Use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the status of the operation.</p>
<h3 id="7-version-your-api"><a class="header" href="#7-version-your-api">7. Version your API</a></h3>
<p>Version your API to ensure that changes to the API do not break existing clients.</p>
